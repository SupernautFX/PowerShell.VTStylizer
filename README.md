# PowerShell.VTStylizer
 VTStylizer module is designed to abstract away the need to write out long ANSI Escape Sequences when tryng to add special formatting to text-based Output in PowerShell. The Current Version of VTStylizer adds the '`$VTStyle`' Token Variable to the PowerShell Session. The '`$VTStyle`' Token comes equipped with *many* Modifier Attributes, or Properties, each corresponding with one of the available ANSI Text Formatting Options (Ex. Bold, Italics, Underline, Strikethrough, Flashing, and Hidden), as well as **all 256 ANSI Colors available for either Foreground and/or Background Colorization**! In order to incorporate Ansi Escape Sequences into your Text-Based Output within PowerShell using VTStylizer, simply add the Token associated with the desired effect to the String you wish to Output.
